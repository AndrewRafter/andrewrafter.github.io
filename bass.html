			<p>
				Amplifiers or "Amps" for short, are used to amplify the sound of electric or semi-acoustic guitars. 				
                They are particualarly useful when playing in front of large audiences where the from an acoustic 
                guitar won't be able to reach everyone. A different amp has to be used for bass guitars as the one 
                designed for electric guitars hasn't got a high enough frequency and might blow.

			<p>
				Effects pedals are a great way to change the sound of the guitar and therfore the song. Different 
                effects include changing the octave, creating distortion, tremolo, flange, reverb, delay, 
                compression, volume control, looping.
